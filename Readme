This is my repository to store ansible playbooks, I used while my learning


Serial: value
# to define the number of target macines to run the play concurrently. Thereafter, it will pick other machines in the batch as asfined in serial. This is used inside the playbook.

Forks: value
#this can be defined in the ansible.cfg to define the number of target machines in one go.

Strategy: Free | Linear
#Linear is default which runs task 1 on all machines first then leads to second task. Whereas free  strategy runs all tasks on all machines simultaneously. This can be defined in playbook.



#Error Handling - Default Behaviour
#Running on one server: When a task fails, it stops executing tasks.
#Running on two servers: When a task fails on server 1 but executes successfully on server2, then other tasks on server 1 will not be executed and other tasks on server 2 will be completed properly. 
#To ignore errors and run other tasks on server 1 use the following handler in the task.
ignore_errors: True


- name: first play
  hosts: server1
  vars:
    my_name: Dinesh
