This is my repository to store ansible playbooks, I used while my learning


Serial: value
# to define the number of target macines to run the play concurrently. Thereafter, it will pick other machines in the batch as asfined in serial. This is used inside the playbook.

Forks: value
#this can be defined in the ansible.cfg to define the number of target machines in one go.

Strategy: Free | Linear
#Linear is default which runs task 1 on all machines first then leads to second task. Whereas free  strategy runs all tasks on all machines simultaneously. This can be defined in playbook.
